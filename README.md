Lessons learned
* Start sooner
* Also just start making stuff. Anything is better than nothing.
* Renpy converts any upper case letters to lower case in filenames. E.g. file name "earthBlurred.jpg" is accessed by `scene earthblurred`
* Multiple labels just crashes Renpy. Main directory -> errors.txt sometimes helps
* Bad character definitions just crashes Renpy without a good error message. `player = ("[player]")` where player name isn't defined crashes
